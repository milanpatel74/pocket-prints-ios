 * \brief An Adobe360Message is an immutable object that provides an interface that allows access to the contents of

 *
 * \note Adobe360Message objects are constructed using the Adobe360MessageBuilder class and by the readFrom class methods.
 * It is important to note that message objects maintain references to the input and output files that are added
 * via the Adobe360MessageBuilder or are contained within the snapshots, composites, or archives that are used as inputs to the
 * readFrom... methods that may have constructed the object.  Therefore it is imperative that these source files are treated
 * as immutable by the client of the message object for lifetime of the object.
